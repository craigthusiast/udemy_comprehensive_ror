Markdown Syntax Tutorial (use === for h1)
========================

This is an h2 heading (use ----)
--------------------------------

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running, but it's a Markdown syntax tutorial instead.

When you do want to insert a break tag <br /> in Markdown, you can either use an html br tag,  
or you can end a line with two or more spaces,  
then type return.

This is a normal paragraph with a link to [craigthusiast.com](http://www.craigthusiast.com).
Surround the link text in square brackets and immediately follow with URL around parentheses.

> ## Block quotes are useful for highlighting a key theme.
> Mix in > ## headings or normal paragraph lines with starting with > symbol.

## Text Formatting
What if you want to format text as *italics* or **bold**? 
Surround words in single star for italics and double star for bold.

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.  
Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.  
Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.  
Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

## Reasons to use proper formatting in markdown:

1. Be more compelling.
2. Easier to read.
3. Get your points across more effectively.

### Here are some bullets (use ### for no horizontal rule)
Use star, plus, or minus sign. They're all the same.

* Ruby version
* System dependencies
* Configuration
* Database creation
* Database initialization
* How to run the test suite
* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
* Deployment instructions
